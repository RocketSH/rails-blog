# Blog demo 

My goal with this practice is to teach myself Ruby on Rails by building a new web app (using rails).

This week I choose to build a simple blog, where key features include I can create posts with CRUD, visitors can comment on posts, and I can log in log out.

## Dependencies
* Ruby 2.6.5
* PostgreSQL
